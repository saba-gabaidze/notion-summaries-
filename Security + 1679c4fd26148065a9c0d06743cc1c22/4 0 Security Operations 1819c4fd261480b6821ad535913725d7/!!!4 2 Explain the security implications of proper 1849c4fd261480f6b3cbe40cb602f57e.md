# !!!4.2 Explain the security implications of proper hardware, software,
and data asset management.

# Acquisition/Procurement Process

## **Strategic Evaluation**

Assess the organization’s technological needs to ensure compatibility with existing systems and monitoring tools.

## **Identify Deficiencies**

 Evaluate gaps in current infrastructure and define the scope of acquisition.

## **Change Management**

 Submit proposals to the Change Advisory Board for approval of purchases and implementations.

## **Vendor Selection**

Choose vendors based on quality, cost efficiency, reliability, and compliance with security and industry standards.

## **Total Cost of Ownership(TCO)**

Consider not only the purchase price but also maintenance and replacement costs to avoid financial burden.

## **Risk Assessment**

 Conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities and align with security objectives.

## **Compliance Alignment**

 Ensure adherence to legal, regulatory, and industry-specific requirements to avoid legal and reputational risks.

# **Assignment/Accounting Process**

## **Asset Register**

- Maintain a record of all assets, including location, value, and ownership, to ensure everything is accounted for. Assets not in the register may be rogue devices.

## **Standard Naming Convention**

- Use a predefined naming convention (e.g., PC1, DC1, SQL1) to identify assets, helping detect rogue machines.

## **Ownership**

- Assign specific owners to assets to enforce accountability and security. Ownership should be reflected in the asset register.

## **Classification**

- Categorize assets as critical, essential, or non-essential to prioritize support and ensure appropriate security levels.

## **Access Control**

- Link asset ownership to authentication and authorization mechanisms to control who can interact with the asset.

# **Monitoring/Asset Tracking**

## **Inventory**

Maintaining an **asset inventory** means keeping a detailed list of all assets in the organization. This list should include information like the asset’s name, type, location, and condition

### **IBM Maximo**

- Enterprise Asset Management solution with features for planning, scheduling, maintenance, inventory, and IoT integration.

### **ServiceNow Asset Management**

- IT Asset Management solution with a CMDB for tracking hardware, software, and licenses, optimizing asset utilization, and ensuring compliance.

## **Enumeration**

- Assign unique identifiers (serial numbers) to assets for easy tracking.
    - **Tools for Enumeration:**
        - **Mobile Device Management (MDM):** Tracks mobile devices and can remotely wipe lost or stolen ones.
        - **Barcode Scanners & Labels:** Use QR codes for asset tracking.
        - **Asset Tags:** Attach serial numbers and barcodes to assets.
        - **RFID Tags:** Use RFID readers for efficient asset identification.
        - **GPS/Location-Based Services:** Track assets with tools like Apple AirTag.
        - **Microsoft Intune:** Cloud-based tracking for devices.
        - **Network Mapper (NMAP):** Identifies services and vulnerabilities on networked assets.
- **Software & License Tracking:** Ensure that software and licenses are tracked and comply with regulations alongside hardware.

# **Disposal/Decommissioning**

- **Overview:** Final phase of an asset’s life cycle, ensuring secure removal, decommissioning, and disposal to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and ensure regulatory compliance.

## **Sanitization**

### **Data Wiping/Overwriting**

- Overwrite storage media with random data.

### **Secure Erase**

- Use commands to permanently remove data.

### **Degaussing**

- Expose magnetic media to a strong magnetic field to render data unreadable.
- **After Sanitization:** Donate devices to schools or charities if appropriate.

## **Destruction**

- **Shredding:** Mechanically shred storage media.
- **Incineration:** Burn the asset to ashes.
- **Pulverization:** Reduce to small pieces using tools like sledgehammers.
- **Crushing:** Apply great force to make the asset unusable.
- **Chemical Decomposition:** Break down components using chemicals.
- **Pulping:** Turn paper waste into pulp.

## **Certification**

- When using third-party destruction services, document and verify the process to ensure legal and organizational compliance.

## **Data Retention Policies**

- Retain data only as long as required by regulations (e.g., medical data: 6–25 years depending on region; tax records: 7 years in the US). Failure to comply may result in fines.
- **Change Management:** Follow proper processes when introducing new assets and disposing of old ones.
