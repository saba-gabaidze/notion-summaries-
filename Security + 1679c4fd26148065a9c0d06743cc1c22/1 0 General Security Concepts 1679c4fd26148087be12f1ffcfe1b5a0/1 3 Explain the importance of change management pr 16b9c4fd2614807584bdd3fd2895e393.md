# 1.3 Explain the importance of change management processes
and the impact to security.

# Change Management Concepts

## **Approval Process**

The approval process ensures that proposed changes align with organizational goals. It involves sending changes to stakeholders for input, followed by documentation for tracking and approval. This process applies to both large and small decisions, like system upgrades or access changes.

## **Ownership**

 Ownership refers to the person responsible for implementing a change. In security, this is often the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who ensures tasks like encryption are handled effectively.

## **Stakeholders**

Stakeholders are individuals or groups with a vested interest in the companyâ€™s operations. Key stakeholder categories include:

- **Shareholders/Investors**: Focus on financial performance.
- **Employees**: Impact company productivity and reputation.
- **Suppliers**: Provide essential resources and materials.
- **Creditors/Banks**: Lend financial resources.
- **Government/Regulatory Bodies**: Ensure compliance with laws.

## **Impact Analysis**

Before making changes, an impact analysis helps assess the potential effects on security and identifies risks to mitigate.

## **Test Results**

Testing new security measures ensures they function as expected and offer the needed protection.

## **Backout Plan**

 A backout plan provides a way to undo changes if something goes wrong, ensuring the organization can revert to its previous state and avoid extended vulnerabilities.

## **Maintenance Window**

- A scheduled time for applying updates or changes, usually during off-peak hours, to minimize disruption.

## **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**

 SOPs are detailed guidelines that ensure tasks are completed consistently and correctly, like a pre-flight checklist.

# Technical implications

## **Allow Lists/Whitelists**

These lists grant access only to approved applications or users, ensuring that unauthorized software or malware cannot run. Once set up, the system will block anything not on the list.

## **Deny Lists/Block Lists**

These lists block access to specified applications or users. They help prevent harmful software and unauthorized access to your network.

## **Restricted Activities**

These actions are blocked to prevent vulnerabilities or disruptions, such as unauthorized software installations, system modifications, and access to critical servers or sensitive data.

**Change Management Considerations**

## **Downtime**

 Periods when systems are offline, either due to failure or maintenance, which can result in revenue loss. Minimizing downtime is critical, and a business continuity plan can help prevent it.

## **Service Restart**

Restarting systems can disrupt user access and hinder security efforts. Attackers may exploit security gaps during restarts.

## **Application Restart**

 Improper restart procedures can lead to data inconsistencies or corruption, affecting application integrity and security.

## **Legacy Applications**

 Older applications with outdated security and no vendor support can pose security risks.

## **Dependencies**

Some services depend on others to function. If one service fails, it can prevent the application from running.

# Documentation

## **Updating Diagrams**

- Keep network topology and system architecture diagrams current to avoid discrepancies and potential security gaps.

## **Updating Policies/Procedures**

Regularly update policies and procedures to reflect changes. Outdated documents can lead to incorrect actions, security risks, or non-compliance.

# Version Control

Version control helps track and manage changes to files, ensuring only authorized changes are made. It prevents unauthorized modifications and keeps a record of who made changes and when. This is important for security because it helps identify and fix potential issues caused by unauthorized changes. It is also useful in coding and app development to keep track of the latest version.
