# 1.1 Compare and contrast various types of security controls.

# â€¢ Categories

 

## Technical

Technical controls help reduce vulnerabilities in systems like networks, software, and data management by ensuring integrity, preventing unauthorized access, and protecting sensitive data. Examples include:

- **Firewalls:** Protect networks by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking unauthorized access.
- **Data Encryption:** Converts sensitive data into unreadable code, ensuring security even if intercepted, requiring a decryption key for acce

## **Managerial Controls**

Managerial controls help reduce risks by guiding employees through policies, procedures, and practices. They align employee actions with organizational goals and enhance safety. Examples include:

- **Performance Reviews:** Regular assessments to align employee activities with organizational goals and improve performance.
- **Risk Assessments:** Identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks to reduce potential threats.
- **Code of Conduct:** Guidelines for ethical behavior to prevent misconduct and promote integrity.

## **Operational Controls**

Operational controls focus on daily activities to ensure efficiency and quality in delivering goods and services. They guide individuals to optimize performance. Examples include:

- **Incident Response Procedures:** Steps to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents, minimizing impact and restoring normal operations.
- **Security Awareness Training:** Educating employees on security threats and best practices to prevent incidents caused by human error.
- **User Access Management:** Controlling user access to systems and data through provisioning, access reviews, and revocation to prevent unauthorized access.

## **Physical Controls**

Physical controls protect tangible assets and facilities from unauthorized access and security risks. Examples include:

- **Access Control Vestibule:** A buffer zone with multiple authentication steps (e.g., access card, biometric verification) to restrict entry.
- **Biometric Locks:** Use unique characteristics (fingerprints, facial recognition) to grant access.
- **Guards/Security Personnel:** Visible deterrents who monitor, patrol, and enforce security protocols.
- **Security Fences:** Physical barriers (e.g., metal, barbed wire) to deter unauthorized access.
- **CCTV Surveillance:** Cameras monitoring and recording activities to identify breaches and deter threats.
- **Mantraps:** Enclosed areas with interlocking doors, ensuring only one person passes at a time.
- **Vehicle Barriers:** Controls to prevent unauthorized vehicles from entering (e.g., bollards, hydraulic barriers).
- **Tamper-Evident Seals:** Seals that show signs of tampering, ensuring the security of containers or equipment.
- **Panic Buttons/Alarms:** Quick alerts for security breaches or emergencies.

# Control Types

## **Preventive Controls**

Prevent problems before they occur. Examples:

- **Firewalls:** Block unauthorized network access.
- **Employee Training:** Prevent workplace accidents.
- **Quality Control Checks:** Prevent manufacturing defects.

## **Deterrent Controls**

Discourage undesirable behaviors by creating a perception of risk. Examples:

- **Surveillance Cameras:** Deter criminal activity.
- **Warning Signs:** Discourage burglars.
- **Strong Passwords/MFA:** Discourage unauthorized access.

## **Detective Controls**

Identify problems or risks after they occur. Examples:

- **Financial Audits:** Detect fraud or irregularities.
- **SIEM Systems:** Detect suspicious network behavior.

## **Corrective Controls**

Address issues after detection to restore normalcy. Examples:

- **Backup & Recovery Systems:** Restore data after failures.
- **Patches/Fixes:** Address software vulnerabilities.

## **Compensating Controls**

Alternative measures when primary controls aren't feasible. Examples:

- **Additional Approval Layers:** For transactions without automated controls.
- **Secondary Authentication:** When primary methods fail.
- **Increased Physical Security:** When technical controls are compromised.

## **Directive Controls**

Provide guidelines to ensure compliance. Examples:

- **Code of Conduct:** Outline acceptable behavior.
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Detail task completion steps.
- **Regulatory Requirements:** Mandate specific reporting procedures.
