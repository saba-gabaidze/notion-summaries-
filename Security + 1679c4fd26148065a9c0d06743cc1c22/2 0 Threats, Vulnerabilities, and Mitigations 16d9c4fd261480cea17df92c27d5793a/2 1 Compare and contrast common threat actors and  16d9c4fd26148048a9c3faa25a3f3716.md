# 2.1 Compare and contrast common threat actors and motivations.

# Threat Actors

## **Nation States+**

- Government-sponsored entities that engage in cyber operations for national interests. They possess substantial resources and advanced capabilities for attacks like espionage, data theft, and sabotage.

## **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)+**

 A sophisticated, prolonged cyberattack by highly skilled actors (often nation-backed or organized cybercriminals) aimed at stealing data or causing damage over time.

## **Unskilled Attackers+**

 Individuals with minimal technical skills, often using off-the-shelf or dark web tools. They may cause disruption or breaches for personal gain or notoriety.

## **Hacktivists+**

 Individuals or groups using cyberattacks to promote political, ideological, or social causes. Tactics often include website defacement, leaking sensitive data, or service disruptions.

## **Insider Threats+**

 Threats originating within an organization, such as employees or contractors who misuse their access. These threats can be intentional (e.g., revenge, financial gain) or unintentional (e.g., phishing attacks).

## **Organized Crime+**

Cybercriminal groups operating like businesses, engaging in activities like ransomware, credit card fraud, and identity theft for monetary gain. They are often well-structured and hierarchical.

## **Shadow IT+**

 Unauthorized technology used within an organization without IT department oversight. While not always malicious, it creates security risks by exposing vulnerabilities.

# Attributes of actors

## Internal vs. External Threat Actors

- **Internal**: Originate within the organization (employees, contractors, partners). Familiar with systems and may attack for financial gain, revenge, or personal reasons.
- **External**: Originate outside (individual hackers, crime groups, nation-states). Use reconnaissance and social engineering to exploit espionage, data theft, or financial fraud.

## Resources/Funding Availability

- **Well-Resourced**: Backed by financial support or government resources. Examples: nation-states, APTâ€™s. They deploy advanced tools, zero-day vulnerabilities, and multifaceted attacks.
- **Limited Resources**: Small-scale attackers rely on basic tools or social engineering. While simpler, these attacks remain effective, especially against less-secure targets.

## Sophistication/Capability

- **Highly Sophisticated**: Advanced skills, custom malware, and stealth techniques. Examples: nation-states, APT groups, and organized syndicates.
- **Less Sophisticated**: Script kiddies or low-skilled attackers using accessible tools and pre-made malware. Can still cause significant damage, often purchasing tools on the dark web.

# Motivation

## **Data Exfiltration+**

- Stealing sensitive data (e.g., personal, financial, or intellectual property) for sale or exploitation.
- Leads to economic losses, damaged reputations, and legal issues.

## **Espionage+**

- Nation-states or entities gather intelligence, government secrets, or industrial data via covert cyber activities.

## **Service Disruption+**

- Attacks on critical infrastructure and public services to harm reputation or create chaos, often driven by political, ideological, or personal motives.

## **Blackmail+**

- Extorting victims using stolen data or ransomware, where encrypted data is held hostage for a ransom.

## **Financial Gain**

- Cybercriminals target financial institutions, businesses, and individuals for monetary rewards (e.g., credit card fraud, cryptocurrency theft).

## **Philosophical/Political Beliefs**

- Hacktivists aim to promote causes by defacing websites, leaking data, or disrupting services.

## **Ethics**

- Ethical hackers expose vulnerabilities to improve security practices.

## **Revenge**

- Disgruntled individuals (e.g., ex-employees) launch cyberattacks to harm personal or organizational targets.

## **Disruption/Chaos**

- Actors seek to create instability by targeting entities to sow confusion.

## **War (State-Sponsored Cyber Warfare)**

- Nations conduct cyber operations to gain strategic advantages in conflicts.
