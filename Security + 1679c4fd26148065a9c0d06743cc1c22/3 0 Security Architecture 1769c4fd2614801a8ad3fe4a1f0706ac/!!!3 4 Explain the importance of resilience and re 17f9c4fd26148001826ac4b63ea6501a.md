# !!!3.4 Explain the importance of resilience and recovery in security
architecture

# High Availability

1. **High Availability Infrastructure**
    - Aimed at withstanding cyberattacks while autonomously detecting, mitigating, and healing vulnerabilities in real-time. It ensures continuous service availability and robust cybersecurity, keeping data secure and operations unaffected, even in a constantly changing threat environment.

## **Least Utilized Host**

- The load balancer monitors the health of servers and directs traffic to the least utilized one (with the lightest workload). This is effective when server loads fluctuate, optimizing resource usage. For example, if one server (Web 3) is the least busy with only 50 requests compared to others, it will receive the new request.

## **Affinity (Session Persistence)**

- Ensures that requests from the same client go to the same backend server during a session. The load balancer uses identifiers like the client's IP address to maintain session consistency. This is also known as a sticky session.

## **DNS Round Robin**

- Rotates requests across a set of servers (e.g., Web 1, Web 2, and Web 3) using DNS, starting with the server with the least number of requests. Once the end of the list is reached, the sequence repeats, ensuring an even distribution of traffic across servers.

## Load Balancer Configurations

### **Active/Active Configuration**

- Multiple load balancers work together as a dynamic array, actively distributing traffic and caching requests for improved efficiency.
- Users are typically directed to the same load balancer on subsequent visits for consistency.
- **Key Consideration:** Operates close to maximum capacity, meaning if one load balancer fails, the remaining one must handle the entire workload. This can lead to performance issues, especially as it’s already managing its own traffic.

### **Active/Passive Configuration**

- Involves one active load balancer and one or more passive load balancers in standby mode.
- The active load balancer handles incoming requests, while the passive ones constantly monitor the active node’s health.
- **Key Benefit:** If the active node fails, a passive node seamlessly takes over, ensuring service continuity and reducing downtime.
- **Key Advantage:** Provides redundancy and higher reliability, as the system can continue operating without interruption.

## Clustering

### **Active-Passive Node Configuration**

- In a clustering setup, there are two nodes: one active and one passive. Both are accessed through a virtual IP (VIP) on the frontend and share a quorum disk on the backend.
- The active node handles traffic and processes, while the passive node remains in standby mode, ready to take over if the active node fails.

### **Quorum Disk**

- The quorum disk is a shared storage resource accessed by both the active and passive nodes. It stores crucial configuration and state information, acting as a neutral arbiter that helps in decision-making within the cluster.
- It is essential for ensuring that both nodes are synchronized and can determine the state of the cluster, especially in the event of a failure.

### **Witness Server**

- The witness server provides an additional layer of reliability to the cluster. It helps prevent split-brain scenarios (where two nodes mistakenly think they are the active node) by monitoring and assisting in determining the cluster's status.
- It ensures that the cluster operates smoothly by helping the system resolve any ambiguity between the active and passive nodes.

### **Heartbeat Communication**

- Heartbeat communication allows the active and passive nodes to monitor each other's health. The active node regularly sends status updates (heartbeats) to the passive node.
- If the passive node detects a missed or irregular heartbeat, it recognizes that the active node has failed and takes over the responsibilities of the active node.

### **Virtual IP (VIP)**

- The VIP is the public-facing interface of the cluster. It serves as the entry point for external requests and ensures that the cluster remains accessible to users.
- If the active node fails, the VIP allows the passive node to seamlessly take over without disrupting the service, ensuring high availability and minimal downtime.

# Site Considerations

## **Hot Site**

- A hot site is a fully operational backup location that mirrors the primary infrastructure.
- It is staffed, equipped, and ready for immediate data replication and use, enabling rapid recovery.
- **Cloud-based Hot Sites:** With the rise of cloud technology, many organizations now implement hot sites in the cloud, benefiting from rapid recovery, scalability, and cost efficiency. This eliminates the need for physical relocation to a secondary site.

## **Warm Site**

- A warm site is functional but not as immediate as a hot site.
- Data synchronization occurs with a slight delay, often a few hours, through methods like couriered backups or delayed replication.

## **Cold Site**

- A cold site is the most economical option but provides only basic infrastructure (e.g., power and water).
- It lacks pre-installed equipment, staff, or data, requiring significant setup before operations can resume.

## **Geographic Dispersion**

- **Definition:** Geographic dispersion involves distributing data centers and infrastructure across multiple, distant locations.
- **Benefits:**
    - Enhances resilience by avoiding single points of failure.
    - Protects against localized disruptions like natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes, floods).
- **Strategy:** By selecting locations in low-risk areas and spreading critical resources, organizations can ensure continuous operation even if one site is compromised.``

## Cloud Data Replication

**Data Replication**: Creating and maintaining multiple data copies in different locations for redundancy and availability. Replication can occur within regions or across regions, broken down into zones.

### **Storage Replication Models**

1. **Local Redundant Storage (LRS)**:
    - 3 copies in a single data center.
    - Cost-effective but vulnerable to localized disasters.
2. **Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)**:
    - 3 copies across separate availability zones within the primary region.
    - Protects against zone-level failures but not regional disasters.
3. **GEO Redundant Storage (GRS)**:
    - 3 copies in a single data center (primary region) + 1 copy in a secondary region.
    - Protects against regional disasters but lacks zone-level redundancy.
4. **GEO Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS)**:
    - Combines ZRS and GRS.
    - 3 copies across zones (primary region) + 1 copy in a secondary region.
    - Maximizes resilience and availability.

## Data Sovereignty

**Data Sovereignty**: Refers to the regulations governing where data can be stored and processed, based on the country it resides in. It is crucial in disaster recovery planning, especially when choosing recovery sites like hot sites.

- Data sovereignty regulations vary by country and impact the setup of recovery sites across borders.
- Compliance with these regulations is vital for organizations operating globally to ensure proper disaster recovery planning.

# Data Backup Methods

## **Full Backup**

- Backs up all data on the system (files, folders, etc.).
- Provides complete data recovery but uses the most storage space.
- Often done during low system load periods (e.g., weekends).
- Fastest backup method but storage-intensive.

## **Incremental Backup**

- Backs up changes since the last full or incremental backup.
- Saves storage space and requires less backup time.
- Restoration requires the last full backup + all subsequent incremental backups.
- Ideal for organizations with limited storage.

## **Differential Backup**

- Backs up changes since the last full backup.
- Uses more space than incremental backups but less than full backups.
- Grows larger each day.
- Restoration only requires the last full backup + the latest differential backup.

## **Important Backup Features**

### **On-site vs Off-site Backups**

- **On-site**: Stored within the organization's premises, providing quick access but vulnerable to local disasters.
- **Off-site**: Stored away from the primary location (e.g., cloud or remote data center), offering added protection.
