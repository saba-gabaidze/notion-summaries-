# Chapter 14

# **Basic Wireless Commands**

## **`iwconfig`**

:Focuses on wireless interfaces and shows their key details (e.g., ESSID, mode, transmit power). Modes include:

- **Managed**: Connects to an Access Point (AP).
- **Master**: Acts as an AP.
- **Monitor**: Used for wireless monitoring.

## **`iwlist 'interface' scan`**

 Scans and lists available Wi-Fi networks, showing details like MAC address (BSSID), signal strength, encryption status, and ESSID. Itâ€™s useful for identifying Wi-Fi APs for hacking.

## `nmcli` / `nmcli device wifi list`

**nmcli**: A command-line tool for managing network connections. It shows nearby APs with details like SSID, signal strength, security protocols, and allows you to connect to a Wi-Fi AP using `nmcli dev wifi connect SSID password`.

# **Wi-Fi Recon with aircrack-ng (Summary)**

### **1. Put the Wireless Card in Monitor Mode**

- Use `airmon-ng start wlan0` to capture all wireless traffic.

### **2. Capture Wireless Traffic**

- Use `airodump-ng wlan0mon` to gather key data from Access Points (APs), including:
    - **BSSID**: AP MAC address
    - **ESSID**: AP name
    - **CH**: Channel
    - **PWR**: Signal strength
    - **ENC**: Encryption type

### **Tools Used**

- `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, `aireplay-ng`, `aircrack-ng`

# Bluetooth hacking

**1. Enable and Verify Bluetooth Adapter**

- **Check adapter**:
    
    `hciconfig`
    
    - Example Output:`hci0: Type: BR/EDR Bus: USB BD Address: 10:AE:60:58:F1:37 ACL MTU: 310:10 SCO MTU: 64:8`
    - This shows the adapter's MAC address and confirms it is recognized.
- **Bring up the adapter**:
    
    `hciconfig hci0 up`
    
    - No output indicates success.

**2. Scan for Bluetooth Devices**

- **Find devices in discoverable mode**:
    
    `hcitool scan`
    
    - Example Output:`72:6E:46:65:72:66 ANDROID BT22:C5:96:08:5D:32 SCH-I535`
- **Gather detailed information**:
    
    `hcitool inq`
    
    - Example Output:`24:C5:96:08:5D:32 clock offset:0x4e8b class:0x5a020c`
    - Provides the MAC address, clock offset, and device class.

**3. Inspect Bluetooth Communication**

- **Capture Bluetooth data**: Use `hcidump` to sniff and analyze communication.

### **Key Commands Summary**

- **hciconfig**: Manage and query Bluetooth adapters.
- **hcitool**: Scan and gather info about nearby devices.
- **hcidump**: Capture Bluetooth communication.

### **Scanning for Services with `sdptool`**

1. **Purpose**: Discover Bluetooth services on a target device, even if it's not in discovery mode.
2. **Command**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    sdptool browse MACaddress
    
    ```
    
3. **Output Insight**: Shows supported services like **ATT Protocol** (useful for interaction clues).

---

### **Checking Reachability with `l2ping`**

1. **Purpose**: Verify if a Bluetooth device is active and within range.
2. **Command**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    l2ping MACaddress -c NumberOfPackets
    
    ```
    
3. **Output Insight**: Confirms the device is reachable by showing sent/received packets and response times.

---

### **Summary**

- Use `sdptool` to scan services.
- Use `l2ping` to ensure the device is in range and active before interacting.
