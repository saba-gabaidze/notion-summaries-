# Boot loader

- **POST (Power-On Self-Test)**: This is like when the car checks if all parts are working. It makes sure everything is okay before starting.
- **Boot loader**: After the car's check is done, it needs to start the engine. The **boot loader** is like the key that turns on the engine of your computer. The boot loader is saved on your computer's hard drive or SSD, and it helps the computer start running.
    - If your computer is older, it looks in a special place called the **boot sector**.
    - If your computer is newer, it looks in a special place called the **EFI partition**.
- **CMOS values**: After the boot loader helps the computer start, it looks at some important settings like the time and which parts of the computer to use. These settings are stored in the **CMOS**, which is a little memory that keeps track of things even when the computer is turned off.
- **Boot loaders for Linux**: There are different kinds of boot loaders, like **GRUB**, **ISOLINUX**, and **DAS U-Boot**. They’re like different kinds of keys for starting the car, and they help the computer load up its operating system (like Linux). Sometimes, these boot loaders let you pick which system to start, if you have more than one.
- **Kernel and RAM disk**: When the boot loader is working, it helps load the **kernel** (the brain of the computer) and some important files into memory, so the computer can start running and work properly.

**BIOS vs. UEFI**

## 2 stages of boot loader

For BIOS/MBR systems, the boot loader is located in the first 512-byte sector of the hard disk, called the Master Boot Record (MBR). The boot loader checks the partition table to find a bootable partition. Once found, it loads the second-stage boot loader (e.g., GRUB) into RAM.

In EFI/UEFI systems, the UEFI firmware reads the Boot Manager data to determine the UEFI application to launch, such as GRUB, based on the boot entry in the firmware. This method is more complex but offers more flexibility than MBR.

The second-stage boot loader is located in the /boot directory. A splash screen appears, allowing the user to select the operating system and kernel to boot. The boot loader then loads the kernel into RAM and hands control over to it. The kernel is typically compressed, so it first uncompresses itself before checking system hardware and initializing device drivers.

# Initial Ram Disk

The **initramfs** filesystem image contains programs and binary files that perform all actions needed to mount the proper root filesystem, including providing the kernel functionality required for the specific filesystem that will be used, and loading the device drivers for mass storage controllers, by taking advantage of the **udev** system (for user device), which is responsible for figuring out which devices are present, locating the device drivers they need to operate properly, and loading them. After the root filesystem has been found, it is checked for errors and mounted.

The **mount** program instructs the operating system that a filesystem is ready for use and associates it with a particular point in the overall hierarchy of the filesystem (the **mount point**). If this is successful, the initramfs is cleared from RAM, and the **init** program on the root filesystem (**/sbin/init**) is executed.

init handles the mounting and pivoting over to the final real root filesystem. If special hardware drivers are needed before the mass storage can be accessed, they must be in the initramfs image.

**The Initial RAM Disk**

# Text-Mode Login

At the end of the boot process, **init** starts text-mode login prompts where you can type your username and password to access a command shell. If you have a graphical login, you won't see this right away.

Most systems start six text terminals and one graphics terminal, accessible with function keys (F1, F2, etc.). In a graphical environment, you can switch to a text console by pressing **CTRL-ALT + function key** (F7 or F1 usually leads to the GUI).

The default command shell is usually **bash** (GNU Bourne Again Shell), but there are others available. After logging in, the shell shows a prompt, and after typing a command and pressing Enter, it runs the command and shows a new prompt.

# Linux Basics and system startup

The **boot loader** loads both the kernel and the **initramfs** (initial RAM-based file system) into memory so the kernel can use them.

Once the **Linux kernel** is loaded into RAM, it starts by setting up the computer's memory and configuring all connected hardware, like processors, storage devices, and input/output systems. The kernel also loads some essential user applications needed for the system to run.

# **/sbin/init and Services**

Once the kernel has set up the hardware and mounted the root filesystem, it runs **/sbin/init**, which becomes the first process and starts other processes to get the system running. Most processes on the system trace their origin back to **init**, except for kernel processes, which are started directly by the kernel to manage system details.

**Init** is also responsible for keeping the system running and shutting it down cleanly. It manages non-kernel processes, cleans up after them, and restarts user login services and other background system services as needed.

Traditionally, **init** used a method from the 1980s called **SysVinit**, where the system went through runlevels to start and stop services. Each runlevel represented a different system mode, and services were managed by scripts. However, modern distributions have moved away from this method and use newer systems like **systemd**, though they may still support SysVinit for compatibility.

# Startup Alternatives

SysVinit viewed system startup as a slow, serial process, meaning each stage had to complete before the next one could start. This didn’t take advantage of modern systems with multiple processors or cores. It also didn’t prioritize fast startup times, which became important with mobile and embedded devices. Additionally, SysVinit required complex startup scripts, which were hard to keep consistent across different system versions.

To address these issues, two main alternatives were developed:

1. **Upstart**:
    - Created by **Ubuntu** in 2006.
    - Adopted by **Fedora 9** (2008) and **RHEL 6**.
2. **systemd**:
    - First used by **Fedora** in 2011.
    - Adopted by **RHEL 7**, **SUSE**, and **Ubuntu 16.04** (replacing Upstart).

Although the transition to **systemd** was controversial, it has become the standard for most major distributions, making Linux systems more consistent and easier to work with across different versions.

# **systemd Features**

Systems using **systemd** start up faster than older systems because it uses **parallelization**, allowing multiple services to start at the same time instead of in a sequence. This replaces complicated startup scripts with simpler configuration files that define the order and conditions for starting services. Now, **/sbin/init** points to **/lib/systemd/systemd**, meaning systemd manages the init process.

The main command for managing systemd tasks is **systemctl**. Here are some examples of how it's used:

- To **start, stop, or restart** a service (e.g., Apache web server):
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    sudo systemctl start|stop|restart httpd.service
    
    ```
    
- To **enable or disable** a service from starting at boot:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    sudo systemctl enable|disable httpd.service
    
    ```
    
- To **check the status** of a service:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    sudo systemctl status httpd.service
    
    ```
    

In most cases, the `.service` part can be omitted.

# **Linux Filesystems**

Libraries separate books and other media into multiple sections; this organization will depend on the subject matter, audience, media type, and frequency of retrieval. The same concept applies to a filesystem, which is the embodiment of a method of storing and organizing arbitrary collections of data in a human-usable form.

Different types of filesystems supported by Linux:

- Conventional disk filesystems: **ext3**, **ext4**, **XFS**, **Btrfs**, **JFS**, **NTFS**, **vfat**, **exfat**, etc.
- Flash storage filesystems: **ubifs**, **jffs2**, **yaffs**, etc.
- Database filesystems
- Special purpose filesystems: **procfs**, **sysfs**, **tmpfs**, **squashfs**, **debugfs**, **fuse**, etc.

This section will describe the standard filesystem layout shared by most Linux distributions.

# **Partitions and Filesystems**

A partition is a section of storage on a physical device, originally a contiguous part of a hard disk. Today’s devices may be more complex, but we still think of partitions as fixed areas treated as a whole.

A filesystem is a way to store and access files. You can think of a partition as a container for a filesystem. In some cases, a filesystem can span multiple partitions using symbolic links.

**Comparison between Filesystems in Windows and Linux:**

| **Windows** | **Linux** |
| --- | --- |
| **Partition** | Disk1 |
| **Filesystem Type** | NTFS/VFAT |
| **Mounting Params** | DriveLetter |
| **Base Folder** | C:\ |

# The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

 is a set of rules for organizing important files on Linux systems. It helps users, administrators, and developers navigate Linux distributions consistently without having to relearn the layout.

Linux uses the ‘/’ character to separate paths (unlike Windows, which uses ‘\’) and doesn't use drive letters. Multiple drives and partitions are mounted as directories in a single system. For example, removable media like USB drives and CDs are usually mounted under `/run/media/username/disklabel` or `/media` in older systems. If you have a USB drive labeled "FEDORA," it might be found at `/run/media/student/FEDORA` on a system with the username "student." A file called "README.txt" on that drive would be at `/run/media/student/FEDORA/README.txt`.

# **More About the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**

Okay! Imagine your computer is like a big house with different rooms for different things. The "root directory" `/` is like the main entrance to the house. Inside, there are many rooms (called "directories").

Some rooms are for the most important things your computer needs to work, like `/boot`, which helps start up the computer. But there are also rooms for things that aren’t as important for starting the computer, like `/usr`, which is where extra programs and software for users are kept.

Now, Linux is very picky about names. So if you have a room named `/boot`, it’s different from a room named `/Boot` or `/BOOT`. They are all separate rooms, just because the names are different!

To understand where programs are kept, you can look at `/usr` to see how it is organized compared to other rooms right under the main entrance (`/`). This shows you where the important stuff is, and where the extra stuff is stored.
