# The Device Directory /dev

`/dev` directory:

1. **Device Representation**: The `/dev` directory contains files representing devices on the system.
2. **Device File Types**:
    - `c` = Character devices (e.g., keyboards, serial ports).
    - `b` = Block devices (e.g., hard drives, USB drives).
    - `l` = Symbolic links (e.g., `cdrom -> sr0`).
    - `d` = Directory (e.g., `/dev/block`, `/dev/cpu`).
3. **Permissions**: Device files have permissions similar to regular files (e.g., `crw-------` for character devices).
4. **Common Devices**:
    - **Block devices**: Represent storage devices (e.g., `sda1`, `sdb`).
    - **Character devices**: Represent devices that send and receive data one character at a time (e.g., `agpgart`, `autofs`).
5. **Alphabetical Listing**: Devices are listed alphabetically by default.

# How Linux Represents Storage Devices

- **Logical Labels**: Drives are given logical labels that depend on where and when they are mounted.
- **Legacy Device Names**:
    - Floppy drives: `fd0` (now obsolete).
    - IDE/E-IDE drives: `hda` (legacy).
- **Modern Device Names**:
    - **SATA/SCSI drives**: Represented as `sda`, `sdb`, `sdc`, etc.
    - **Partitioning**: Drives can be split into partitions, labeled with numbers (e.g., `sda1`, `sdb2`).
- **Serial Naming**: Drives are named sequentially (`sda`, `sdb`, `sdc`, etc.) in alphabetical order.
- **Major Number**: The serial letter after `sd` represents the major number, indicating the driveâ€™s position.

# Drive Partitions(`fdisk` )

- **Partitioning Drives**: Drives can be split into partitions to separate data (e.g., swap file, home directory, `/`).
- **Partition Labeling**:
    - Each partition is labeled with a minor number (e.g., `sda1`, `sda2` for partitions on the first SATA drive).
    - Example: `sda1` is the first partition on the first drive, `sda2` is the second, and so on.
- **Partition Type**: Partitions can have different types (e.g., Linux, swap, extended).
- **Viewing Partitions**:
    - Use the `fdisk -l` command to list partitions.
    - Shows partition details like size, type, and filesystem (e.g., `Linux`, `swap`, `NTFS`).
- **Filesystem Types**:
    - Linux uses filesystems like **ext2**, **ext3**, **ext4**.
    - Non-native filesystems (e.g., **NTFS**, **exFAT**) are used by Windows/macOS but supported in Linux for compatibility.
- **Swap Partition**: The swap partition (e.g., `sda5`) acts like virtual RAM when physical memory is full.

# Listing Block Devices(`lsblk`)

- **Device Naming**:
    - Devices in `/dev` are prefixed with either `c` or `b`.
        - **`c`** = Character devices (e.g., mice, keyboards) that transfer data one character at a time.
        - **`b`** = Block devices (e.g., hard drives, DVD drives) that transfer data in blocks (multiple bytes).
- **Character Devices**:
    - Communicate by sending and receiving data one character at a time.
    - Example devices: **mice**, **keyboards**.
- **Block Devices**:
    - Communicate by sending and receiving data in blocks (many characters or bytes at once).
    - Example devices: **hard drives**, **DVD drives**.
- **Listing Block Devices**:
    - Use the `lsblk` command to list information about block devices.
    - Displays devices and their partitions in a tree structure.
    - Shows details like size, type, and mount points.
    - Example: `sda` with partitions `sda1`, `sda2`, and `sda5`.
- **Mount Points**:
    - The output of `lsblk` also shows where devices are mounted in the filesystem (e.g., `sda1` mounted at `/`, flash drive mounted at `/media`).

# `mounte/umoute`

Mount points are directories where devices are attached. The common mount points are

`/mnt`

and

`/media`

- Devices like external USB drives and flash drives are often mounted in `/media` automatically.
- You can manually mount a device to `/mnt`.

- Use the `mount` command to manually mount a device to a directory.
- Example:
    - `mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt` mounts the device `sdb1` at `/mnt`.
    - `mount /dev/sdc1 /media` mounts the flash drive at `/media`.
- Ensure the mount point is an **empty directory** to avoid hiding its contents.

**`fstab`**

- The `/etc/fstab` file lists filesystems that should be mounted automatically during boot. It is read during system startup.

`umount /dev/sdb1` - unmounts the device `sdb1`.

# `FD`

The **`df`** command in Linux is used to display **disk space usage** for the file systems mounted on your system. As a hacker or security professional, it is useful to quickly check available storage, identify mounted file systems, and detect any unusual or suspicious file system usage. Below are key features and things you need to know about the **`df`** command for cybersecurity purposes.

# `fsck`

`fsck` (Filesystem Check) is used to check for errors on a filesystem and to attempt repairs if necessary

first you need tu `umount` device to `fcsk`

`fsck -p /dev/sda1` -After unmounting the device, you can run `fsck` to check and fix the filesystem. To automatically repair any errors found, use the `-p` option:

# COMMANDS LEARNED!!!!!!!

- **`fdisk -l`** - Lists all partitions on the system.
- **`lsblk`** - Lists information about block devices in a tree structure.
- **`mount`** - Mounts a device to a directory.
- **`umount`** - Unmounts a device.
- **`fsck`** - Checks and repairs a filesystem.
- **`df`** - Displays disk space usage for mounted filesystems.
