# rsyslog Logging Deamon

**Files**

: Common files include:

- `/etc/rsyslog.conf` (main configuration file)
- `/etc/rsyslog.d` (additional configuration files)
- `/etc/default/rsyslog`, `/etc/init.d/rsyslog` (start/stop configuration)
- `/etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog` (log rotation configuration)

# Logging Rules

- **Format**: `facility.priority action`
    - **Facility**: Refers to the program generating the log (e.g., `mail`, `kern`, `user`).
    - **Priority**: Specifies the types of messages to log, from `debug` (lowest) to `panic` (highest). If `` is used, all messages of any priority are logged.
    - **Action**: The location where the log is stored, typically in `/var/log/`.
- **Valid Facilities**:
    - `auth`, `authpriv`: Security/authorization messages
    - `cron`: Clock daemons
    - `daemon`: Other daemons
    - `kern`: Kernel messages
    - `lpr`: Printing system
    - `mail`: Mail system
    - `user`: User-level messages
    - ``: All facilities
- **Valid Priorities** (from lowest to highest):
    - `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `warn`, `error`, `err`, `crit`, `alert`, `emerg`, `panic`
- **Example Rules**:
    - `mail.* /var/log/mail.log`: Logs all mail events to `/var/log/mail.log`.
    - `kern.crit /var/log/kernel.log`: Logs kernel events with `crit` priority or higher to `/var/log/kernel.log`.
    - `.emerg :omusmsg:*`: Logs all emergency events to all logged-in users.

# `logrotate.conf`

- **Configuring logrotate**:
    - **File**: `/etc/logrotate.conf`
    - **Key Directives**:
        - `u`: Sets the time unit for rotation (default is `weekly`).
        - `v`: Specifies the number of times logs should be rotated. For example, `rotate 4` keeps 4 weeks' worth of logs.
        - `w`: Ensures a new (empty) log file is created after rotation.
        - `x`: Optional; use `compress` to compress archived logs.
- **How Rotation Works**:
    - Logs are archived, and old ones are renamed (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log` becomes `/var/log/auth.log.1`, then `.2`, etc.).
    - After reaching the set backup limit (e.g., 4), the oldest log (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log.4`) is deleted.

# **Shredding Log Files**

- **Better Solution**: Shredding files is more secure. It not only deletes the file but also overwrites it multiple times, making recovery much more difficult.
- **Shred Command**: A built-in Linux tool that overwrites files to prevent recovery.
    - **Basic Command**: `shred <FILE>`
    - **Options**:
        - `f`: Forces permission changes if needed.
        - `n <NUM>`: Specifies how many times the file is overwritten (default is 4).
        
        `shred -f -n 10 /var/log/auth.log.`
        
        `shred -f -u  /var/log/auth.log` - deleting
