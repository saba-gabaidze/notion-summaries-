# Tests

# Exam 23

## **FQDN**

 **(Fully Qualified Domain Name)** is the complete domain name that uniquely identifies a host in the DNS (Domain Name System) hierarchy. It consists of the host name and the domain name, including the top-level domain (TLD).

Example: [**www.example.com**](http://www.example.com/)

- **www** = host name
- **example** = second-level domain
- **com** = top-level domain (TLD)
- The trailing dot (.) represents the root domain, though it’s usually omitted in common usage.

## **OCSP**

 **(Online Certificate Status Protocol)** is a protocol used to check the revocation status of digital certificates in real-time. It provides a faster way to validate a certificate by allowing clients to query a Certificate Authority (CA) to verify if a certificate is revoked, rather than downloading a large **CRL (Certificate Revocation List)**.

OCSP is more efficient than CRL because it provides immediate responses and only checks the status of the specific certificate in question.

## **EIRP**

**(Effective Isotropic Radiated Power)** refers to the total power radiated by an antenna, taking into account both the transmitter's output power and the antenna's gain. It is a measure of the strength of the radio signal as it would be seen from a specific point in space, assuming the antenna radiates uniformly in all directions (isotropic).

## **RSSI**

**(Received Signal Strength Indicator)** is like the "strength" of the Wi-Fi signal you're receiving. It tells you how good or bad the connection is between your device (like a phone or laptop) and the Wi-Fi access point (the router or Wi-Fi box).

- A **high RSSI** means the signal is strong and your connection should be good.
- A **low RSSI** means the signal is weak, and your connection might be slow or unreliable.

Think of it like the volume on your music. If the signal is strong (high RSSI), it's like the music is loud and clear. If it's weak (low RSSI), it’s like the music is soft or fuzzy.

# Exam 22

## **multimeter**

is a tool used to measure electrical values like **voltage**, **current**, and **resistance**. It combines multiple functions in one device, allowing you to test circuits and troubleshoot electrical issues.

- **Voltage (V)**: Measures the difference in electric potential between two points.
- **Current (A)**: Measures the flow of electric charge through a circuit.
- **Resistance (Ω)**: Measures how much a component resists the flow of electricity.

Multimeters can be used for both **DC (direct current)** and **AC (alternating current)** systems. They usually have a **digital** or **analog** display to show the measurements.

## **Fusion splicing**

 is a technique used to join two optical fibers together by **melting** the fiber ends with heat to create a **permanent** connection. This method is commonly used in fiber-optic communication systems to ensure minimal signal loss and high-quality transmission.

## **Spectrum analyzer**

 is a device used to measure and analyze the frequency spectrum of electrical signals. It shows how the signal's power is distributed across various frequencies, which is useful for troubleshooting, testing, and designing electronic systems.

**Key points:**

- **Frequency Range**: It can display signals across a wide range of frequencies (from very low to high GHz).
- **Display**: The results are typically shown on a screen, with the horizontal axis representing **frequency** and the vertical axis representing **signal strength (amplitude)**.
- **Types of Signals**: It can analyze various signals, including **radio waves**, **TV signals**, and **microwave signals**.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Some analyzers provide real-time measurements, allowing you to see how signals change over time.

## Wire stripper

A wire stripper is a tool used to remove the plastic insulation from electrical wires, exposing the metal inside. It has sharp blades designed to cut through the plastic without damaging the wire. There are different slots for various wire sizes, so you can choose the correct one based on the thickness of the wire you're working with.

## iperf

**iPerf** is a tool used to measure the **performance** of a network, especially the **speed** and **bandwidth** between two devices. It helps in testing how well data can be transferred over a network.

It works by setting up one device as a **server** and the other as a **client**. The client sends data to the server, and iPerf measures how much data is transferred and how fast.

## **NetFlow**

 is a network protocol developed by Cisco that collects and monitors network traffic data. It helps network administrators understand the flow of data between devices on a network by capturing information about traffic patterns and connections.

NetFlow records **flow information** like:

- **Source IP address** (where the traffic is coming from)
- **Destination IP address** (where the traffic is going)
- **Source and destination ports** (the specific services or applications involved)
- **Protocol type** (e.g., TCP, UDP)
- **Amount of data transferred**
- **Duration of the flow**

# Exam 21

## Rollover cable

A **rollover cable** is a type of networking cable commonly used for console connections to network devices like routers and switches. It's called a "rollover" because the pinouts at each end of the cable are **reversed** (or "rolled over") compared to a standard straight-through cable.

# Exam 20

## **Tamper protection mechanisms**

 are security measures to prevent, detect, or respond to unauthorized alterations or interference with devices or systems.

## **Access control vestibules**

are physical entry areas that require authentication (e.g., badge or biometrics) before granting access to secure areas, preventing unauthorized entry.

## **Access control hardware**

 includes physical devices (e.g., card readers, biometric scanners, locks) used to manage and restrict access to buildings or secure areas based on authentication.

## **RFID**

**(Radio Frequency Identification)** is a technology that uses radio waves to identify and track objects or people, often used in access control systems with RFID cards or tags for secure entry.

## **Chassis intrusion detection**

 is a security feature that monitors if the physical case (chassis) of a computer or server is opened, triggering an alert to prevent unauthorized access or tampering with internal components.

# Exam 19

## **VDI**

**(Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)** is a technology that allows users to access desktop environments hosted on remote servers rather than on local machines. Instead of running a full operating system on a physical desktop or laptop, users connect to a virtual desktop that resides on a server in a data center or cloud.

## **Captive portal**

A captive portal is a security solution that allows administrators to block network access until users perform a required action, such as logging in, accepting terms, or completing authentication.

## **VNC**

 **(Virtual Network Computing)** is a remote desktop sharing protocol that allows a user to control another computer over a network connection. VNC works by transmitting the keyboard and mouse input from one computer (the client) to another (the server) and sending back the display from the server to the client, effectively allowing the client to see and interact with the server’s desktop.

# Exam 18(security)

## NDP

Network Discovery protocol ipv6

## **RA Guard**

**RA Guard** (Router Advertisement Guard) is a network security feature designed to block **malicious or unauthorized IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages** on a network.

## **DAI**

**(Dynamic ARP Inspection)**

**Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** is a security feature that prevents **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing attacks** on a network. ARP spoofing can allow attackers to intercept, modify, or disrupt network traffic by sending fake ARP messages.

## **CoPP**

**(Control Plane Policing)**

**Control Plane Policing (CoPP)** is a security feature used in networking devices (like routers and switches) to protect the **control plane** from excessive or malicious traffic.

(Cisco-proprietary security feature designed to protect routers and switches against reconnaissance and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.)

---

## **Port Isolation**

Port isolation is a network feature that limits communication between devices connected to different ports on a switch, even if those devices are within the same VLAN. It increases **security** by ensuring that devices cannot communicate directly with each other.

# Exam 17

# **screened subnet**

 also known as a **demilitarized zone (DMZ)**, is a small, isolated network between a private internal network and an external network (usually the internet). Its purpose is to add an extra layer of security by isolating external-facing services like web servers, mail servers, or DNS servers from the internal network.

### **NAC**

**(Network Access Control)**

**Network Access Control (NAC)** is a security solution that regulates and manages access to a network based on a variety of security policies. It controls which devices and users can connect to the network, ensuring that only authorized and compliant devices are allowed access.

# Exam 16!!!!!!

### 1. **Redundancy Protocols (for Backup Routers)**

These protocols are specifically designed to handle **backup routers** or **gateway redundancy**:

- **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)**: Cisco proprietary; provides a backup router for failover.
- **VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)**: Industry-standard protocol; works like HSRP to designate a backup router.
- **FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol)**: This term covers both HSRP and VRRP, plus other protocols used to provide redundancy at the gateway level.

**Memory Tip**: Think **"H & V = High Availability"** (for HSRP and VRRP). These are your main redundancy protocols to back up routers in case of failure.

**2. Routing Protocols (Path Selection but No Dedicated Backup Router)**

These are routing protocols that **reroute traffic** if a primary path fails, but they don't assign a **specific backup router**:

- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**: Focuses on quick path rerouting within a network but does not designate a primary/backup setup.
- **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**: Determines best paths within a network but isn’t used specifically for router failover.

**Memory Tip**: Think **"Routing = Pathfinding, Not Backup"**. These are like **navigators** that figure out paths but don’t have a primary/backup setup.

## **MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)**

 This refers to the average time it takes to repair a failed component or device and get it back to normal operation. It’s a key metric in maintaining system uptime and reliability.

## **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**

 This measures the average time between two consecutive failures of a component or device. It is used to predict the reliability of a system.

## **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**

 This refers to the maximum tolerable period of time required to restore business functions or services after a failure or disaster. It helps organizations set a target for how quickly they need to recover to minimize downtime.

## **Steganography**

 is the practice of hiding secret information within another, seemingly innocent piece of data. The goal is to conceal the existence of the message, making it difficult to detect that there is hidden information.

## **Hashing**

- Hashing is used to ensure data integrity by generating a unique value (hash) for a given input. If the data changes, the hash will also change, making it easy to detect modifications.

## **Digital signatures**

- Digital signatures ensure integrity by providing a way to verify that the data has not been altered. A digital signature uses encryption to create a unique signature for the data, ensuring that the sender cannot alter the message without detection.

## **Non-repudiation**

 Non-repudiation ensures that someone cannot deny performing an action (e.g., sending a message), but it is related to security and accountability, not availability.

## **DLP system (Data Loss Prevention system)**

- DLP systems are designed to monitor and control the movement of sensitive data within and outside of an organization. They can detect potential data leaks or unauthorized data transfers, which is particularly useful for preventing insiders from stealing or leaking sensitive information.

# Exam 15!!!!

## DLP

**Data Loss Prevention** refers to a set of software or hardware-based security solutions designed to detect and prevent unauthorized access, use, or transmission of sensitive or confidential information. DLP tools monitor and control data movement across endpoints, networks, and storage systems to ensure that critical data is not leaked, stolen, or improperly accessed.

## **NDA**

 **(Non-Disclosure Agreement)**

 is a legal contract between two parties where one party agrees to keep the confidential information shared by the other party private and not disclose it to third parties. NDAs are commonly used to protect sensitive business information, trade secrets, or intellectual property.

## **SLA**

**(Service Level Agreement)** is a formal agreement between a service provider and its users or customers that defines the expected level of service, including the nature, availability, quality, and scope of the services provided. It outlines specific metrics, such as uptime guarantees, response times, and performance targets.

## **MOU**

 **(Memorandum of Understanding)** is a document that outlines the responsibilities, expectations, and intentions of two or more parties in achieving a particular goal or mission. It is typically used to establish a formal agreement on the terms of collaboration, but it is generally not legally binding.

## **NIC teaming**

(also known as **Link Aggregation**) is the process of combining multiple physical network adapters (NICs) into a single logical interface. This provides increased throughput (by distributing traffic across multiple network links) and redundancy (if one NIC fails, the other can take over). It's commonly used to enhance network erformance and provide fault tolerance.

# Exam 11

## **IaC** (Infrastructure as Code).

IaC is a DevOps practice where infrastructure (such as servers, networks, and storage) is defined and managed through code rather than through manual configuration. It allows for automatic deployment, scaling, and management of infrastructure by writing scripts or using configuration management tools like Terraform, Ansible, or Puppet. This practice ensures consistency, reduces human error, and speeds up the deployment process.

## **Rapid elasticity**

 in cloud computing refers to the ability to automatically scale computing resources (such as CPU, storage, or network capacity) up or down based on the demand. This means that when the demand increases, the system can quickly allocate more resources, and when the demand decreases, it can scale back the resources, ensuring efficient usage and cost management.

## **On-demand self-service**

 in cloud computing allows consumers to independently provision, manage, and control the volume and type of computing resources they need, such as storage, processing power, or network capacity. This feature enables users to adjust their resource usage according to their needs without requiring direct interaction with the service provider.

# Exam 10

## **MX (Mail Exchange)**

 **records** are DNS (Domain Name System) records that map a domain name to a list of mail servers responsible for receiving email for that domain. These records specify the mail servers' hostnames and their priority (in case multiple servers are available for redundancy).

## **SOA** (Start of Authority).

It stores administrative information about a domain, such as the primary DNS server and the domain administrator's email.

## **SRV** (Service Record).

A **SRV record** in DNS specifies information about a **host and port** for specific services on a network. It allows services like VoIP, LDAP, or other protocols to be found by specifying both the **hostname** and the **port number** where the service is available.

## **NS** (Name Server).

An **NS record** specifies the **name servers** that are responsible for a domain. It lists the DNS servers that can be used to query for information about the domain.

## **Recursive Query**

 is a type of DNS query where the DNS resolver (client) asks a DNS server to fully resolve the domain name. The server must either return the **final answer** (the IP address) or indicate that it cannot resolve it (e.g., if the domain doesn't exist). If the server cannot resolve the query, it will ask other servers on behalf of the client until the answer is found or an error is returned.

## **SDN** (Software-Defined Networking).

**SDN** is a technology that allows network infrastructure to be managed and controlled through software rather than traditional hardware-based methods. It simplifies network management by centralizing control, making it easier to configure, manage, and optimize network resources. SDN separates the control plane (decision-making) from the data plane (data forwarding), allowing for more flexible and automated management of networks.

## Exam 9

## **Authentication Header (AH)**:

Provides data integrity, authentication, and optional anti-replay services. AH ensures that the data has not been tampered with and comes from a trusted source. However, it does not provide encryption.

## **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)**:

Provides confidentiality (encryption), along with data integrity and authentication. ESP can be used with or without encryption, but encryption is typically the main purpose. It protects the data payload of IP packets.

## **Security Associations (SA)**

- A **Security Association** is a set of policies and keys that are used to secure communication between two devices.
- It consists of:
    - **SPI (Security Parameter Index)**: Identifies a unique SA for each direction of communication.
    - **Keys**: Shared secret keys used for encryption and authentication.
    - **Policies**: Defines how the data should be protected (e.g., which algorithms are used for encryption and authentication).

## **reservation**

 refers to a permanent IP address assignment from a DHCP server. When a DHCP reservation is set, a specific device (like a server or printer) is always assigned the same IP address based on its MAC address, even though the IP address is assigned through the DHCP server.

## **CNAME** (Canonical Name)

record allows multiple domain names to resolve to the same IP address by creating an alias for a domain. When a CNAME record is used, one domain name points to another domain name, which in turn resolves to an IP address. This allows multiple domain names to share the same IP address.

## Exam 8

## **SQL*Net** (the Oracle database communication protocol) - **1521**

## **MySQL database system** is - **3306**

## Exam 7

## **SLAAC**

is a feature in IPv6 that allows a network node (like a computer or router) to automatically configure its own IPv6 address without the need for a DHCPv6 server. It uses the network's router advertisement (RA) messages to configure the node’s IPv6 address based on the network prefix, and then combines that prefix with its own unique identifier (often derived from its MAC address) to form the full IPv6 address.

# exam 5

## CWDM

(Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing) and DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) are both multiplexing techniques used in fiber-optic communication to transmit multiple signals over a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths (or channels) of light.

CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) are not used for fiber-optic communication; they are methods for managing access to communication channels in wireless and other networks.

# !!!!!!!!!!

## **Maximum Power per Port** = **15.4 watts** (this is the key number to remember for basic PoE).

## **RADSL**

 stands for **Rate-Adaptive Digital Subscriber Line**. It is a type of **DSL** technology that automatically adjusts its connection speed based on the quality of the phone line, which can vary due to factors like distance from the service provider or the quality of the copper wiring.

### 1. **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)**

- **What it is**: In DAC, the owner of a resource (like a file or database) has full control over who can access it. The owner can grant or revoke permissions to other users.
- **How it works**: For example, if you have a document on your computer, you can decide who gets to read it, write to it, or execute it. This is often used in personal or small-scale systems.
- **Example**: If you create a file on a system, you, as the owner, can set permissions to allow specific users to access it.

### 2. **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**

- **What it is**: MAC is a stricter access control model. It is enforced by the system, not the owner, meaning users cannot change the access control settings. Permissions are usually based on security labels or levels.
- **How it works**: Users and resources are assigned security labels (e.g., top secret, secret, unclassified), and access to resources is determined based on these labels. The system enforces the rules, not individual users.
- **Example**: In a military setting, files might be labeled as "Top Secret," and only users with the proper clearance (security label) can access them, regardless of ownership.

### 3. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

- **What it is**: RBAC assigns permissions based on roles rather than individual users. Users are assigned roles (e.g., admin, user, guest), and each role has specific permissions.
- **How it works**: Instead of giving permissions to users individually, you define roles (such as admin, manager, employee), and then assign permissions to those roles. Users are granted access based on their roles.
- **Example**: In a company, an "Admin" role might have access to all files, while a "User" role only has access to certain files.

### 4. **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**

- **What it is**: ABAC is a more flexible and dynamic access control model. It uses attributes (such as user attributes, resource attributes, or environmental attributes) to make decisions about access.
- **How it works**: Access decisions are made based on a combination of attributes like the user's job title, the time of day, the resource type, and more. For example, access can be granted to a file based on the user's department or the time of day.
- **Example**: A user in the "HR" department might have access to salary files, but only during office hours. Alternatively, a user may be given temporary access to a resource based on specific conditions or context.

### Key Differences:

- **DAC** gives control to the owner of a resource (flexible but less secure).
- **MAC** enforces rules set by the system or administrators (more secure but less flexible).
- **RBAC** assigns permissions based on roles, making it easier to manage for large groups.
- **ABAC** uses a combination of attributes for more complex and dynamic access control decisions.

### Summary:

- **DAC**: Owner decides who gets access.
- **MAC**: System-enforced rules based on labels.
- **RBAC**: Roles are assigned access, not individual users.
- **ABAC**: Access is based on attributes like job role, time, or context.

## **feasible successor**

 is a concept in networking, specifically in the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). It refers to a backup route to a destination that meets certain conditions, ensuring that it is a viable alternative path if the primary route (the successor) fails.

## **XML Security** protects XML data by

1. **XML Encryption**: Encrypts (locks) the data so only authorized people can read it.
2. **XML Signature**: Signs the data to verify that it hasn’t been changed and proves who sent it.

It ensures that the data is **private**, **untampered with**, and **authentic** when exchanged or stored.

## **NFV**

 (Network Functions Virtualization) is a network architecture concept that uses **virtualization technologies** to manage and deploy network functions, such as routing, firewalls, load balancing, and intrusion detection, in software instead of relying on specialized hardware appliances.

## CDN

**copies of content** (like web pages, images, videos, etc.) are stored on multiple **servers** located in different geographical regions. These servers are called **edge servers**
