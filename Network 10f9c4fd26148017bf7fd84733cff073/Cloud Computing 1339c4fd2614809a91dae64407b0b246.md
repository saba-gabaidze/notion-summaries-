# Cloud Computing

# **Hypervisor**

is a software layer that enables one **host machine to run multiple OSes (as virtual machines)** simultaneously, managing complex interactions between virtual and physical hardware.

**Key points:**

- **Role:** Manages virtual machines by handling all **I/O requests** for hardware resources (RAM, CPU, storage, etc.).
- **Example hypervisors:** **VirtualBox** and **VMware Workstation** both allow adding/removing **virtual hardware** (e.g., virtual hard drives, network cards, RAM).
- **Virtual BIOS:** Hypervisors can even provide a **virtual BIOS/System Setup** for each VM, simulating a real computer.
- **Performance tip:** Each VM uses the **host machine’s real CPU and RAM**. For smooth operation with multiple VMs, ensure the host has **sufficient CPU and ample RAM**.

# **Benefits of Virtualization**

- **Power Saving:** Multiple virtual servers can run on one physical machine, reducing the number of machines needed and cutting power usage. For example, one computer can handle **Windows and Linux servers** together instead of using separate machines.
- **Hardware Consolidation:** Instead of dedicating a powerful server to a single OS, **add RAM** and run several servers on one machine. Saves on **hardware costs and space**.
- **System Recovery:** Virtualization makes recovery easier. **Snapshots** let you save a VM's current state, so if something goes wrong, you can quickly return to a previous snapshot. This helps with **system uptime** but isn't a long-term backup.
- **System Duplication:** Since **VMs are files**, you can easily **copy them**. For instance, teaching 20 students about Ubuntu? Copy the VM to 20 computers. Need an extra web server? **Copy and start** a duplicate.
- **Research Potential:** Virtualization lets you run **many OS versions on one computer**. Useful for testing software across versions (e.g., Windows 7, 8, 10) without needing separate physical PCs.

**Notes:**

- **RAM is key:** The more VMs you run, the more **RAM** you need.
- **VMs as files:** Shut-down VMs are just files on your hard drive.

## **Virtualization in Modern Networks**

- **Virtualized Servers:** Many **web and email servers** today are virtualized, as virtualization has become standard in server management.
- **Type-2 Hypervisors (like VirtualBox, VMware Workstation):** These run **on top of an existing OS** (the host OS), allowing virtualization but with added overhead from the host system.
- **Bare-Metal Hypervisor (Type-1):** **Directly installed on hardware** with no host OS in between, also known as a **bare-metal** hypervisor. This setup **boosts performance** by removing extra layers.
    - **Example:** **VMware ESXi** is a popular bare-metal hypervisor that runs directly on hardware and only focuses on managing VMs. It's often installed on a **USB flash drive**, letting the server dedicate all disk space to VM storage or even keep VMs on a **storage area network (SAN)**.
- **Key Differences:**
    - **Type-1 (bare-metal):** Runs directly on hardware, used for **high-performance virtual servers**.
    - **Type-2:** Runs on an existing OS, more suited for **desktop use or testing**.

**Summary:** Bare-metal hypervisors like **ESXi** are small, efficient, and dedicated solely to **hosting VMs**—ideal for data centers and enterprise-level networks.

## **Hypervisors for Bare-Metal Virtualization**

On Intel-based systems, bare-metal hypervisors include **VMware ESXi**, **Microsoft Hyper-V**, and **Citrix XenServer**. These can handle **remote VM storage, live migration**, and **virtual network setups**.

- **VMware ESXi:**
    - **Features:** Small disk footprint, scalable from **single server to full data center**.
    - **Advantages:** Pioneers new features, **broad third-party support**, and a large user community.
- **Microsoft Hyper-V:**
    - **Availability:** Included with **Microsoft Server and Windows 10**.
    - **Advantages:** **Deep integration** with Microsoft software, **supports Linux VMs**.
    - **Market Impact:** Gaining popularity, backed by Microsoft’s development efforts.
- **Citrix XenServer:**
    - **Background:** Built on **open-source Xen** project and Linux.
    - **Advantages:** **Low cost** or free, popular with **cloud providers** like Amazon and IBM, solid choice for cloud infrastructure.
    - **Note:** Open-source nature makes it flexible and budget-friendly.

**Additional Hypervisor:**

- **Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM):**
    - **Integration:** Built into Linux's **kernel**, KVM supports **low-level interactions** and resource management.
    - **Usage:** Not as widely adopted as others but is **native to Linux** and could be found in varied Linux environments.

**Summary:** Each hypervisor offers unique strengths—**ESXi** for scalability, **Hyper-V** for Microsoft compatibility, **XenServer** for cloud use, and **KVM** for Linux integration.

### **Administering a Hypervisor**

- **Remote Administration:** Hypervisors like **ESXi** and **Hyper-V** are not managed directly on the physical server. Instead, you use management tools such as:
    - **VMware vSphere Client** for ESXi
    - **Microsoft Hyper-V Manager** for Hyper-V
- **Functionality:** These tools allow you to:
    - Create and configure virtual machines (VMs)
    - Maintain and monitor the VMs from a **client computer**.
- **VM Operation:** Once a VM is created and running (e.g., a web server), you can close the management tool. The VM will continue to operate independently on the server, requiring only **occasional maintenance**.

**Summary:** Using client applications like vSphere Client or Hyper-V Manager makes it easy to manage VMs without needing to be directly on the server, allowing for efficient and flexible administration.

## **Scaling Virtualization**

- **Increased Flexibility:** Virtualization allows for more efficient use of resources as operations scale up. It transforms physical servers into a flexible resource pool.
- **Analogy with Money:**
    - Before money, trading goods was inefficient (e.g., trading a hammer for a chicken). If a hammer's worth is more than one chicken, it complicates trade.
    - In virtualization, a physical server (like a hammer) can serve multiple purposes. Instead of having only two servers used for one task each, virtualization allows the servers to be treated like money—**common, divisible units** of resources.
- **Server Optimization:**
    - Mario, with two physical servers, can create a **centrally managed server cluster** with virtual machines (VMs).
    - This setup allows him to allocate just the right amount of resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) to each VM based on need, minimizing waste.
- **Resource Pooling:**
    - As Mario adds more servers to the cluster, he can better distribute resources across VMs, enhancing overall efficiency.
    - **Growth Potential:** A growing cluster enables advancements in **data storage, virtual networking,** and **software-defined networking** for even greater flexibility and efficiency.

**Summary:** Virtualization shifts the management of resources from rigid allocations to flexible, efficient use, similar to how money allows for more straightforward exchanges than barter. As the scale of operations increases, virtualization maximizes resource utilization and simplifies administration.

# **Data Storage in Virtualized Environments**

- **Storage Utilization Issues:**
    - Individual hosts often underutilize or overutilize storage, leading to inefficiencies where some drives sit empty while others run out of space.
    - Maintaining drives across multiple hosts can be cumbersome. Losing a drive can lead to inconvenience or loss of critical services.
- **Consolidating Storage:**
    - To address these issues, you can consolidate storage from all hosts into a separate system. This approach enhances efficiency and simplifies management.
    - Two popular methods for centralized storage are **Storage Area Networks (SAN)** and **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**.

**Storage Area Networks (SAN)**

- **Concept:**
    - A SAN pools multiple hard disks and presents them over the network as logical disks, making them appear to client computers as if they are local hard drives.
- **How it Works:**
    - The SAN operates at the **block level**, allowing the client operating systems to read and write data over the network without the performance overhead of managing a file system.
- **Infrastructure Options:**
    - **Fibre Channel (FC):** High-performance storage with dedicated cables and protocols, but can be costly and clumsy for long distances.
    - **iSCSI:** Utilizes TCP/IP to connect devices using SCSI over standard networks. More cost-effective but can suffer from performance issues due to additional processing.
    - **InfiniBand (IB):** Competes with FC and iSCSI, offering high throughput with specialized hardware.

**Network Attached Storage (NAS)**

- **Concept:**
    - A NAS is a dedicated file server that operates its own file system and is designed specifically for storing and serving files.
- **How it Works:**
    - Unlike SANs, NAS handles file system management for all clients, which can introduce performance bottlenecks, especially in high-demand virtualization environments.
- **Cost vs. Performance:**
    - NAS systems are generally simpler and more affordable, making them attractive for less intensive applications but may not meet the performance needs of high-performance virtualization clusters.

**summery**

- Both SAN and NAS provide solutions for centralizing storage in virtualized environments, but they cater to different needs. SAN is better suited for high-performance applications due to its block-level access, while NAS offers a simpler, file-based storage solution that may be limited by performance in intensive use cases.

# Virtual Networking

1. **Virtual Switches:**
    - **Function:** Virtual switches perform Layer 2 switching, allowing multiple VMs on a single physical server to communicate as if they are on a physical network.
    - **Bridging NICs:** Virtualization provides IP addresses to VMs by bridging the physical NIC to virtual NICs. This connection allows VMs to share a single physical NIC while each obtaining a unique MAC address.
    - **Configuration:** Virtual NICs are configured similarly to physical NICs, including IP addresses and subnet masks.
2. **Distributed Switches:**
    - **Growth Management:** As virtual networks expand, managing them becomes more complex. Distributed switches allow for centralized management of multiple virtual switches, simplifying configuration and maintenance.
    - **Centralized Configuration:** This includes managing VLAN assignments and trunking across the network, ensuring consistent settings and reducing administrative overhead.
3. **Virtual Routers and Firewalls:**
    - **Dynamic Configuration:** Virtual routers enable dynamic reconfiguration of networks as VMs are moved across hosts, maintaining network efficiency and performance.
    - **Resource Allocation:** Like VMs, virtual routers can have resources allocated to them based on traffic demands, avoiding the need for larger physical routers.
    - **Virtual Firewalls:** These can provide security for virtual servers, particularly in scenarios where physical firewalls are impractical.
    

**Additional Considerations**

- Virtual networking enhances flexibility and resource utilization in virtualized environments, allowing for rapid scaling and dynamic management of network resources.
- Notable products in this space include **Brocade’s Vyatta vRouter** and **Cisco’s Cloud Services Routers**, which provide robust solutions for virtual routing and security.

**Software Defined Networking (SDN)** 

is an innovative approach to networking that separates the traditional functions of a network into different layers, specifically decoupling the control plane from the data plane. Here’s a breakdown of its key concepts:

- **Control Plane**: This part of the network is responsible for making decisions about where traffic should be sent. It involves protocols that determine the best path for data, like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). Traditionally, each network device (like routers and switches) has its own control plane that handles this task.
- **Data Plane**: This layer is responsible for the actual movement of data packets based on the instructions it receives from the control plane. It reads incoming packets and forwards them to their destination according to the routing tables created by the control plane.
- **Network Controller**: In SDN, the control plane is centralized in a software-based controller, which has a comprehensive view of the entire network. This network controller communicates with both physical and virtual devices, directing them on how to manage traffic.
- **Programmability**: One of the most revolutionary aspects of SDN is that the network controller is programmable. This means network administrators can write software applications to define how the network behaves and responds to different conditions, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability.

# **The Service-Layer Cake**

- **Understanding the Cloud**: The cloud consists of servers and networks that make up the Internet, but what differentiates it is the software layers that enhance the hardware's value.
- **Service Layers**: Users typically interact with user-friendly applications (like Dropbox, Gmail, and Facebook) that are built on top of these layers. This "sweet icing" represents the software services that simplify complex tasks.
- **Seamless Integration**: A well-designed cloud implementation allows for a smooth interaction between local resources (the user's hardware) and cloud resources, making the user experience seamless.

The passage highlights that while the underlying hardware is essential, the real power of cloud computing lies in the services that simplify and enhance how we interact with that hardware.

## **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

- **Role of Programmers**: While programmers excel at coding, developing a web application requires more than programming skills. It involves managing infrastructure, including system and database administration, as well as a variety of tools for development and monitoring.
- **PaaS Functionality**: A PaaS provider offers a comprehensive platform that includes all necessary tools for deploying, administering, and maintaining web applications. This platform sits atop an underlying infrastructure, which may be provided by an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider.
- **Developer Experience**: The complexity of the infrastructure is abstracted away from the developer. They focus solely on deploying and running their application without needing to manage the underlying hardware or systems.
- **Example - Heroku**: Heroku is an early example of a PaaS provider that simplifies the development and scaling of web applications. Its user-friendly management console allows developers to easily adjust application capacity and integrate additional services, significantly reducing setup time.

PaaS effectively streamlines the development process, allowing programmers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure and tools.

## **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

- **Definition and Position**: SaaS is the top layer of the cloud service model. It represents software applications that are hosted and provided over the internet rather than installed locally on individual devices.
- **Evolution**: Traditionally, software applications were sold as physical copies, such as those found on optical discs in retail stores. However, many applications have transitioned to being delivered as services from centralized online servers.
- **Example - Microsoft Office 365**: A prime example of SaaS is Microsoft Office 365. The Office suite, which includes applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, has shifted from traditional retail sales to a subscription model. Users now pay an annual fee to access the software, allowing them to either download the applications or use them directly online through a web browser.
- **User Experience**: This transition offers a seamless experience for users, as they can easily log into their Microsoft account to access and manage their applications without dealing with installation discs or local software updates.

SaaS simplifies software access and management, enabling users to utilize powerful applications without the complexities of traditional software installation.

## Cloud Delivery Models
