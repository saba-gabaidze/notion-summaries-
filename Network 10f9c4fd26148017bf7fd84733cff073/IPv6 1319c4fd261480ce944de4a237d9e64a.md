# IPv6 Prefix Lengths

IPv6 uses **prefix lengths** to determine if a packet should stay on the local network or be routed out to the internet. Key rules for IPv6 prefix lengths:

1. **Maximum Prefix Length**:
    - The last **64 bits** of an IPv6 address are typically generated by the NIC (network interface card), so the **prefix length does not exceed /64**.
2. **Standard Prefixes Distributed**:
    - **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)** allocate **/48 prefixes** to large ISPs and organizations needing many addresses.
    - ISPs often **use an additional 16 bits for subnetting**, then allocate **/64 prefixes** to individual end users.
3. **Link-Local Address Prefix**:
    - **Link-local addresses** have a fixed prefix of **/64**.

In summary, a **/64 prefix** is standard for end users and link-local addresses, while larger allocations like **/48** are given to entities managing many subnetworks.

# Multicast  (ff0x::)

IPv6 does away with **broadcast** addresses, instead using **multicast** and **anycast** addressing to direct packets more efficiently. Here's a summary:

1. **Multicast**: IPv6 replaces IPv4 broadcast with multicast, which sends packets to specific groups of systems, instead of everyone. IPv6 multicast addresses begin with `ff0x::` (where `x` indicates the scope, like `ff02::2` for all routers). Only systems set up to listen to a multicast address receive those packets, while others ignore them.
2. **Anycast**: Allows multiple systems to share the same IP address. Routers send packets to the nearest system with that address. This is common with DNS servers, where the nearest root DNS server handles the request, speeding up responses.
