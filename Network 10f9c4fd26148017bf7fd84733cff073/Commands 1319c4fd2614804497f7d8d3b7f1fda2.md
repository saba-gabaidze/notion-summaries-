# Commands

# Tracert/Traceroute

**Traceroute Utility Overview**

- **Purpose**: Answers where packets go on the Internet and how they reach their destinations.
- **Command**: Use **tracert** (Windows) to display the path packets take to a remote device.

**How It Works**:

- Utilizes **TTL** (Time to Live), time-outs, and **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) error messages.
- Useful for troubleshooting by identifying which router causes failures when a destination becomes unreachable.

**Usage**:

- Type `tracert <DNS name or IP address>` in the command prompt.
- Output shows a list of routers (DNS names/IP addresses) the packet passes through and the time taken for each hop.

**Example Output**:

- Lists each hop with its response time in milliseconds (ms).
- Useful for checking if a server is reachable and diagnosing network issues.

**Key Points**:

- Each hop represents a router; if the trace stops, start troubleshooting there.
- **Asterisk (*)** in output means the attempt took longer than the time-out, indicating a busy router or a slow link.
- Disabling **ICMP** on routers enhances security by hiding router locations from potential attackers.
- Repeating addresses and **TTL** timeouts suggest a **routing loop**.

**Takeaway**: **Traceroute** is a valuable tool for identifying network paths and troubleshooting connectivity issues.

# Ipconfig/Ifconfig

**Using ipconfig and ifconfig**

**Purpose**:

- **ipconfig** (Windows) and **ifconfig** (Unix/Linux/Mac) display current TCP/IP configuration, including IP address, DNS, WINS, and default gateway.

**ipconfig Utility**:

- **IPv6 Enabled**: Shows IPv6 configuration by default on newer systems.
- **Basic Command**: Type `ipconfig` in the command prompt.
- **Example Output**:
    - Lists interfaces (Ethernet, Wireless) with their IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways.
    - Disconnected adapters are shown as logical interfaces due to IPv6.
- **Detailed Command**: Use `ipconfig /all` for more information, including:
    - Host name, DNS suffix, DHCP lease times, and MAC addresses.
- **Renewing IP**:
    - Use `ipconfig /renew` to obtain a new IP from DHCP.
    - For **elevation**, right-click Command Prompt and select **Run as Administrator** to execute commands requiring elevated permissions.

**ifconfig Utility**:

- **Function**: Similar to ipconfig, but can also configure network interfaces.
- **Command Syntax**: `ifconfig interface [address [parameters]]`.
    - Without parameters, shows all configured interfaces.
    - Example command: `ifconfig eth0` displays details about the specified interface.
- **Example Output**:
    - Shows interface type, MAC address, IP address, broadcast address, and subnet mask.

**Key Differences**:

- **ipconfig** is mainly for viewing configuration.
- **ifconfig** can configure network interfaces as well.

**Takeaway**: **ipconfig** and **ifconfig** are essential for managing and troubleshooting network configurations on their respective platforms.

# **Ping**

The **ping** utility is a fundamental tool in TCP/IP networking, utilized for two main purposes:

- **Checking Host Response**: Determine if a specific host is responsive.
- **Verifying Connectivity**: Check if a host can be reached across the network.

Basic Syntax

```bash
bash
Copy code
ping hostname_or_IP_address

```

Example Output

When you ping a host, you might see output like this:

```python
python
Copy code
Pinging 204.153.163.2 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 204.153.163.2: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128
...

```

Common Options

You can enhance the functionality of ping with various switches. Here are some useful options:

- **t**: Pings the specified host until stopped (use Ctrl+C to stop).
- **n count**: Specifies the number of echo requests to send (default is 4).
- **l size**: Sets the size of the packet to send.
- **Flood ping** (Linux): `ping -f <hostname or IP>`

- **w timeout**: Specifies the timeout for each reply in milliseconds.
- **a**: Resolves IP addresses to hostnames.

Practical Uses

- **Continuous Pinging**: Use `ping -t <IP_address>` to keep pinging a device continuously, useful for monitoring connectivity.
- **Testing IPv6**: You can ping IPv6 addresses with `ping -6 <IPv6_address>`.
- **Local Interface Check**: Ping your local machine with `ping 127.0.0.1` or `ping localhost`.

Troubleshooting

Ping is an excellent tool for troubleshooting network issues. If you can't reach a host, it may indicate connectivity problems, misconfigured networks, or firewall issues.

# ARP

Here are the key **ARP** commands to remember:

- **View ARP table**: `arp -a`
    
    Displays all ARP entries in the cache.
    
- **Add a static ARP entry**: `arp -s <IP address> <MAC address>`
    
    Adds a static mapping for the specified IP address and MAC address.
    
- **Delete an ARP entry**: `arp -d <IP address>`
    
    Removes the specified IP address from the ARP table.
    
- **View ARP entries for a specific interface**:
    - **Windows**: `arp -a -N <interface>`
    - **Linux**: `ip neigh show` (since ARP is typically integrated with the IP command).

# nslookup/dig

- **Interactive mode**:
    
    Simply type `nslookup` to enter interactive mode, where you can run multiple queries.
    
- **Basic query**: `nslookup <hostname>`
    
    Retrieves the IP address associated with the specified hostname.
    
- **Reverse lookup**: `nslookup <IP address>`
    
    Finds the hostname associated with the specified IP address.
    
- **Specify DNS server**: `nslookup <hostname> <DNS server>`
    
    Queries a specific DNS server for the hostname.
    
- **Set query type**: `set type=<record type>` (e.g., `set type=MX`, `set type=TXT`)
    
    Changes the type of DNS record to query for (e.g., MX records for mail servers).
    

# Mtr/pathping

```bash
bash
Copy code
pathping [options] <hostname or IP>

```

Key options to consider:

- **`n`**: Do not resolve addresses to hostnames (speeds up the process).
- **`h <max_hops>`**: Specify the maximum number of hops (default is 30).
- **`p <timeout>`**: Set the timeout for each probe in milliseconds.
- **`q <number>`**: Set the number of echo requests to send per hop (default is 5).

An example command might look like this:

```bash
bash
Copy code
pathping -n -h 20 google.com

```

# Route

- **Display the routing table:**`route print`
- **Add a route:**`route add <destination> mask <subnet_mask> <gateway>`
    
    Example:
    
    `route add 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1`
    
- **Delete a route:**`route delete <destination>`
    
    Example:
    
    `route delete 192.168.1.0`
    
- **Change a route:**`route change <destination> mask <subnet_mask> <gateway>`
    
    Example:
    
    `route change 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.254`
    

**Options for the Route Command**:

- **f**: Clears the routing table of non-host routes, loopback routes, and multicast routes.
- **p**: Makes added routes persistent (remains after reboot).

# nbtstat

Here are the important `nbtstat` commands you should learn, formatted for easy copying:

- **Display NetBIOS over TCP/IP statistics:**`nbtstat -s`
- **Display the name table for a specific remote computer:**`nbtstat -a <remote_name>`
    
    Example:
    
    `nbtstat -a COMPUTER1`
    
- **Display the name table for a specific IP address:**`nbtstat -A <IP_address>`
    
    Example:
    
    `nbtstat -A 192.168.1.10`
    
- **Display local NetBIOS names:**`nbtstat -n`
- **Display the names in the NetBIOS name cache:**`nbtstat -c`
- **Clear the NetBIOS name cache:**`nbtstat -R`
- **Reload the NetBIOS name cache:**`nbtstat -RR`

# netstat

Here are the **netstat** commands for Windows:

- `netstat -a` # Display active connections
- `netstat -n` # Show addresses and port numbers in numerical form
- `netstat -o` # Display active connections and process IDs
- `netstat -r` # Display routing table
- `netstat -e` # Show Ethernet statistics
- `netstat -s` # Display protocol statistics
- `netstat -l` # Show listening ports (Note: this may not work on Windows)
